                <p>
                    As part of my research at UNCC, I developed a Text Viewer Platform using Streamlit and Python.
                    This platform includes a user-friendly login and signup page integrated with a SQL database for user management and authentication. Users can upload text files and easily view them on the platform, offering a seamless text viewing experience. 
                    To enhance usability and user engagement, I implemented a history feature to track user interactions and file uploads. Additionally, to ensure data persistence, uploaded files are saved to a server, allowing users to access their files at any time.

                <p>
                    I developed a Double-Ended Heapify Program in C++, demonstrating proficiency in data structures and algorithm design. This program efficiently performs double-ended heapification on an array, supporting both min and max heap constructions. 
                    It includes an efficient double-ended heapify algorithm, ensuring optimal performance for various heap types. Additionally, user-friendly input and output interfaces have been implemented, allowing users to easily input data and view the results. 
                    Extensive testing and optimization were carried out to ensure the program's accuracy and efficiency, particularly when handling large datasets.
